# GRASP-and-GVNS
Academic project on the performance of two metaheuristics in a Maximum Diversity Problem

## What to see:

One can find the main code for the metaheuristics in `engine.py`. The script `behindAlpha.py` contains the code necessary for iterate the GRASP method over the different instances in order to callibrate the $\alpha$ (randomness) parameter.
